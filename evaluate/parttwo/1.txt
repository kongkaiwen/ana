B: Hello.

Ana: How can I help you?

B: I can't remember if I've taken my medication.

Ana: 10:20am, B takes one tylenol capsule.

Ana: I have on record that you require two medications once per day.  

Ana: Thus you need to take one capsule of vicodin.

B: Ok thanks.

B: I'm taking my vicodin right now.

Ana: Noted.
