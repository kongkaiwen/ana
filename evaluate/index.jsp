				<h1>Kevin's Evaluation</h1>

				<p>Hello! Thanks so much for helping me with my thesis evaluation.</p>
				<p>Before you begin I'll briefly explain my thesis.  My project revolves around the idea of building a companion for the elderly.  The two tasks I have focused on is Information extraction from text and question generation.  The problem is that it is difficult to evaluate questions based on how "human-like" they are.  This is where you come in!  I ask that you go through each section and complete at least 5 scenarios.  Remember to click the submit button!</p>
				
                <p>For the first part of the evaluation we ask that you examine a statement and possible following questions.  Determine which question best suits the situation.</p>

                <p>In this part of the evaluation we ask you to speak with two agents and determine which sounds more human-like.</p>
