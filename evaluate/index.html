				<h1>Kevin's Evaluation</h1>

				<p>Hello! Thanks so much for helping me with my thesis evaluation.</p>
				<p>Before you begin I'll briefly explain my thesis.  My project revolves around the idea of building a companion for the elderly.  The two tasks I have focused on is information extraction from text and response generation.  The problem is that it is difficult to evaluate questions based on how "human-like" they are.  This is where you come in!  I ask that you go through each section and complete 5 scenarios.  Remember to click the submit button!</p>
				
                <p>In this part of the evaluation we ask you to speak with two agents and determine which sounds more human-like.</p>

                <p>For the second part you need to speak with our agent and evaluate the knowledge base that is created.  Determine if anything is missing or incorrect.</p>
